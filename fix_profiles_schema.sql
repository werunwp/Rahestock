-- Check if profiles.user_id exists, if not we need to understand the schema
-- First, let's see the actual structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles' AND table_schema = 'public';

-- If user_id doesn't exist but id does, and profiles links to auth.users via id
-- Then the profiles table might be using id as the foreign key directly
-- In that case, we need to match on 'id' instead of 'user_id'
