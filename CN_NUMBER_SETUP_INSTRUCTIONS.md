```

## ðŸ“‹ How to Use CN Numbers

### For Offline Couriers:

1. When you send a package via offline courier (not using the API)
2. The courier will give you a **Consignment Number (CN)**
3. Enter this CN number in the sale record:
   - Either when creating the sale
   - Or by editing an existing sale

### Benefits:

- âœ… Track all offline courier shipments
- âœ… Keep CN numbers organized with each sale
- âœ… Easy to reference when following up with courier
- âœ… Complete audit trail for deliveries
